# Introduction 
This repo contains thirteen files----nine issues, one excel, one ppt and one business planã€‚

I'll do the introduction to these parts respectively
# Issues
There are totally nine issues, all of them come from the website https://nanoporetech.com/zh

The nanopore sequencing mentioned in all paper is used for detecting the bacteria in various water sample

The samples may come from wasted, ocean or river.

But all of them need to amplify the DNA so that the sample can get the sequencing standard

By the way, there are two similar issues, one is the original one, the other is the figure version, which means there's only figures.
# Excel
**"simple conclusion for each paper" **is a simple summary of all the issues mentioned above

You can easily find the purpose of each issue as well as the application of nanopore 
# PPT
**"water detection"** can be seen as a expanded version of excel file.

It contains the more detailed purpose, sequencing process, sequecing results and so on

You can also get the original website for each paper in ppt

And it also shows if there's possible to get the raw data or code
# Bussiness plan
File **"Nanopore-integration-clinic"** is not the water detection issue, actually is a business plan about the sequencing technology used in clinic

The author claim he puts the MinION platform in the clinic and set up the integration machine.

However, there's only few things about the key part in machine, you can contact with the author if you are interested in the machine or technology
